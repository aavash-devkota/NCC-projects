 * Create a class Shape that contains instance variable length, breadth and height. 
 * Create a default constructor that sets the value of instance variable to zero, 
 * constructor with two parameter that will sets the value of length and breadth only and 
 * constructor with three parameter that will sets the value of length, breadth and height. 
 * After this create calcAreaRectangle() that calculates the area of rectangle, 
 * calcVolumeBox() that calculates volume of box and display the result. 
 * 
 * 1. Create first object of Shape wihich will have name rectangle and calls constructor with two parameter and calAreaRectangle() method
 * 2. Create second object of Shape that will have name Box which will call constructor with three parameter and calcVolumeBox() method.
